        <h3>What the people say about the Huskyies?</h3>
        <p>
          So most books, online articles, wikis, whatever I read about huskies
          say they're crazy. The moment you let them off the leash they take off
          never to be seen again, this is my main concern. We have a cottage and
          the dog would probably spend most of its time there but the yard isn't
          fenced in. Would it be possible to have the dog just roam the yard
          with us while we do yard work or walk off leash? Or would a husky run
          off the first chance it gets? Would it ever get over running off?
        </p>

          They are born to run first and question later. I have chased mine down
          too many times to count. They are older now, and rarely escape, but
          never, ever, ever will I trust them. They are always on leash, and my
          boy can dig under anything, so I never leave him alone in the back
          yard more than five minutes. It is a pain, but he, and my girl, have
          been so worth the trouble. They are the sweetest, funniest dogs and
          always have so much to say!

          I have a ten month old husky that I take to work with me. I work out
          in the middle of no where in eastern Montana. I let her roam around
          off leash while I'm working. She rarely comes back to me when I call
          her but she usually stays with in 100 yards of me and will check in
          every 10 or 15 minutes then run off and snoop some more. There was
          about a two month period where I had her trained to come back to me
          when I honked my truck horn. I'd say 9 out of 10 times she come
          running to me. But now it's maybe 2 out of 10 times. Not sure why she
          quit coming back to the honk. If you keep you husky happy, well fed
          and loved it will return to you just maybe not right away when you
          call it.

        <h4>Healthy lifestyle for Siberian huskies</h4>
        <p>
          Exercise and inclusion in dog and human socializing are also very
          important as positive outlets for your husky’s high energy levels, so
          they tend to do best in homes with more than one dog and where human
          company is frequent. Mental stimulation is crucial. As Hodges notes,
          the notion that “if you can just give them enough exercise then
          they’ll be happy” doesn’t hold up for huskies. “You can’t out-exercise
          a husky unless you can pull six times your weight 100 miles a day and
          love it,” he says.
